Simulates Tritium CAN communication

Couldn't get the offline compiler working with Windows, but works with Linux.
Use the GCC_ARM compile station with python3, think it's stuck between version 6 and 7 so best method is to download the blinky example from github that has required build files of right version, then overwriting main.cpp and copying in any libraries needed.
